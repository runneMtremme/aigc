Remote sensing of the environment is a field that uses various sensors to collect and analyze data about the Earth's surface and atmosphere. Remote sensing can help us understand natural phenomena, monitor environmental changes, and manage natural resources. One of the most comprehensive and authoritative books on this topic is *Remote Sensing of the Environment: An Earth Resource Perspective* by John R. Jensen.
 
This book covers the principles and applications of remote sensing, from aerial photography to satellite imagery, from electromagnetic radiation to image interpretation, from photogrammetry to multispectral analysis, and more. It also provides examples and case studies of remote sensing applications in various domains, such as vegetation, water, urban, geology, and climate. The book is suitable for students, researchers, and practitioners who want to learn more about the theory and practice of remote sensing.
